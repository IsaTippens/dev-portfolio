A lot of things happened this year. 
In tech specifically: AI/ML brought us generative art and smarter chat bots, Javascript got another frontend library, Twitter is still the same even after being bought out and the global chip shortage took a turn for the better. 

For me, I have finally completed an entire CS degree. This is a big achievement which I have waited a looong time for.

To end off 2022, let's do some last minute planning for 2023.


## Rust / Zig

These are two programming languages I picked up in 2018 and 2021 respectively. 
Neither of which I have spent enough time to memorize the syntax of or confidently build projects with. Seeing Rust as the _better_ C++ and Zig as the _even better_ C alternative, learning these would potentially future proof career longevity until the next C/C++ alternative arrives. 
Rust's no nulls concept is interesting, essentially making sure that errors and no values being handled explicitly in order to prevent alot of runtime errors found in languages that have nulls.
Zig has made me realised there is indeed _compile-time computations_. Something I haven't realised in the many years of coding (Too much python and handling things at runtime).  
By the end of 2023, I want to atleast build something with both of these languages, anything that is blazingly fast âš¡ and I can show off ðŸ˜„.

## Game Dev

I still have ideas I want to try. Many times this year I have hopped between Monogame to Godot to SDL to SDL with Rust to Raylib to Raylib with Rust and only to end up with Monogame since I'm most comfortable using C#. This year I hope to stick with a platform that I can try ideas out easily.

Considering rebuilding a better version of a [game I built in January](https://issaaahhhh.itch.io/plane-shooter).

## Flutter

I haven't kept up on Flutter as much as I used to. Ubuntu now builds its standard applications with Flutter. I've known about Flutter as a mobile ui library, but it's now possible to run it on the web and on desktop.

## Whatever trendy tech thing shows up

There's going to be new trends in 2023, usually a new library or toolkit. As always I am going to try it out as soon as I see it.

## Drawing

A hobby I lost interest years ago, but want to get back into. Hopefully this would be relaxing pastime.

## Looking forward

This list might change, might not be fufilled, but I'll come back to this in a year :)

Let's see how different things can be.
