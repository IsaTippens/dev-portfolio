A lot of things happened this year. 
In tech specifically: AI/ML brought us generative art and smarter chat bots, 
Twitter is still the same even after being bought out and the global chip shortage took a turn for the better. 
For me, I have finally completed an entire CS degree. This is a big achievement which I have waited a looong time for.

To end off 2022, let's do some last minute planning for 2023.


## Rust / Zig

These are two programming languages I picked up in 2018 and 2021 respectively. 
Neither of which I have spent enough time to memorize the syntax of or confidently build projects with. 
By the end of 2023, I want to atleast build something with both of these languages, anything that is blazingly fast and I can show off ðŸ˜„.
